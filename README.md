Newline Delimited Objects Format

The newline delimited objects format is a text-based data format used to store structured data. It is similar to the JSON format but delimited by newline characters instead of commas. Each line in the file contains a single object, and each object can contain multiple key-value pairs separated by colons.

Here is an example of an object in newline delimited objects format:

```
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

This object contains three key-value pairs: "name", "age", and "email". These pairs are separated by colons and enclosed in curly braces.

A newline delimited objects file can contain multiple objects, each separated by a newline character. Here is an example of a file with multiple objects:

```
{"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "email": "john@example.com"}
{"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 30, "email": "jane@example.com"}
{"name": "Bob Johnson", "age": 40, "email": "bob@example.com"}
```

This format is often used for data interchange or storage in web-based applications because it is lightweight and easy to parse. It is also human-readable
